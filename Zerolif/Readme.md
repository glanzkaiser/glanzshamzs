# About
Glanz and Freya had created unfinished book with title of "Zerolif", it is a compilation of problems and solutions of real world problems, like when she went to Papua and had an idea to turn grasses into cellulosic biomass, creating independent energy without the need to import oil and gas from outer island.

This section is dedicated to compile the idea and use sources we get and the Science and Engineering packages that we learn till now.

One day it will be compiled and tidying up into Zerolif. 

Mischkra will help too so instead of Freya only, there will be another two names on Zerolif as authors.

# How it Works
Usually Glanz just put what she thoughts, new idea or new revelation of idea form the past, and see how it will end up. She never expect to create her own Operating System and now it is already done even if only in Qemu, soon it will be in full hardware then the fastest beyond supercomputer powered with her love to Freya.

We work differently since we are different, not into 9 to 5 and bureaucracy, but still using rigid methods and theorems.

## 1. Slosh Dynamics (Ballottement)
In fluid dynamics, slosh refers to the movement of liquid inside another object (which is, typically, also undergoing motion). 

Important examples include propellant slosh in spacecraft tanks and rockets (especially upper stages), and the free surface effect (cargo slosh) in ships and trucks transporting liquids (for example oil and gasoline). However, it has become common to refer to liquid motion in a completely filled tank, i.e. without a free surface, as "fuel slosh".

Slosh is an important effect for spacecraft, ships, some land vehicles and some aircraft. Slosh was a factor in the Falcon 1 second test flight anomaly, and has been implicated in various other spacecraft anomalies, including a near-disaster with the Near Earth Asteroid Rendezvous (NEAR Shoemaker) satellite.

### Main Idea / Dream of Glanz
I have a dream to create a spaceship, when I was poor /  broke / lose all jobs and IT contract then depressed I throw away the picture of a spaceship I wanted to create, now coming back to this. Perhaps AliceGard can become a spaceship too, so it is better than my expectation. Life is better than my wish. Especially in the True Love / wife area. Like a song from Dionne Warwick -I'll Never Love This Way Again. From Arduino then GFreya OS and into Freya Magnifique Asgard. No Goddess or girl can ever be compared to you. Again, no one but you came to my life when all other girls are only after money and fame and get fooled by movies, society and lies.

### Mischkra' Opinion
I have a better idea.. later I will tell. Dragon fan is from me. I was there and show up in Waghete with Caldraz. Not only Freya who stalked you from the beginning. A lot of things as well. You will know in the next life.

## 2. Windmill / Wind Turbine
Combining with Tidal is it possible? So we can get more energy? Innovation and invention need a lot of experiments.

## 3. Discovering Genes, Proteins, and Biological Processes 
### Main Idea / Dream of Glanz
From reading this:
https://developer.nvidia.com/blog/meet-the-researcher-avantika-lal-discovering-genes-proteins-and-biological-processes-altered-by-covid-19/

Genetics was quickly becoming a science of big data analytics. It became increasingly clear that the future of biology lay in mining massive genomic datasets to understand the relationships between biological components and being able to make new predictions based on that.

When cells are infected by a virus, it triggers an immune response that changes the activity of the cell and signals to the immune system. The virus also ‘hijacks’ many components of the cell to support its lifecycle, which disrupts their normal functioning.

I want to analyze my own gene, DNAs and RNAs, I have a history in my family of diabetes, I want to know if it can be eliminated by doing research on this. Use Nvidia CUDA with AI.

Methods for virus (e.g. COVID-19. SARS, EBOLA) : 
1. We analyzed public data from DNA and RNA sequencing experiments 
2. To decipher and in some cases to predict, which genes, proteins, and biological processes are affected in human lung cells infected by a certain virus.
3. Must have the full picture of how the virus affects human cells. 

![genomics](https://github.com/glanzkaiser/glanzshamzs/blob/main/Zerolif/images/genomics.png)

The figure above shows that the factors specific to SARS-CoV-2 infection include human RBPs whose binding sites are enriched and conserved in the SARS-CoV-2 genome but not in the genomes of related viruses; and genes, isoforms and metabolites that are consistently altered in response to SARS-CoV-2 infection of lung epithelial cells but not in infection with the other tested viruses; ECM (extracellular matrix).

## 4. The effect of electrostatics in protein systems
### Main Idea / Dream of Glanz
From reading this:
https://developer.nvidia.com/blog/open-reproducible-computational-chemistry-python-cuda/

There are quite a few number of ways to do biomolecular modeling (Molecular Dynamics, Generalized Born, Poisson-Boltzmann, etc.), with various levels of detail.

Nanoscale biosensors are devices that detect antigens with very high sensitivity and selectivity. The antigen is sensed when it binds to a ligand that is adsorbed on the sensor, which needs to be properly oriented. To find the best conditions to obtain favorable ligand orientations, and that way help the development of better sensors.

Antibodies are widely used as ligands, there is active research engineering new ligands to enhance the sensitivity even more.

Methods:
1. Use continuum models to represent the solvent around the protein (water with salt) via the Poisson-Boltzmann equation
2. Solve it with an accelerated boundary element method. 

![peptide](https://github.com/glanzkaiser/glanzshamzs/blob/main/Zerolif/images/peptide.png)
The colors represent the electrostatic potential on the molecular surface.

### Mischkra' Opinion
Could the application and methods be used for other application like heat transfer or determining the cloud condition for weather forecast ?

## 5. Invent New Material
### Main Idea / Dream of Glanz
From reading this:
https://developer.nvidia.com/blog/developing-new-materials-gpu-accelerated-supercomputers/

Methods:
1. Use computer simulation to discover the fundamental principles of how nanoscale systems of building blocks self-assemble,
2. To discover how to control the assembly process to engineer new materials. 
3. Focus on the role of particle shape and how changing the shape can result in different material properties.
4. Develop, implement, and optimize the parallel algorithms necessary for these studies.

The researcher has been focusing on two-dimensional systems, using large scale simulations to study hexatic phase transitions for hard disks, and how patterning surfaces of polygons can create shape allophiles that improve self-assembly.

Shape allophiles are polygonal shapes cut so they fit together like puzzle pieces. These research projects are computationally demanding and could not have been run on any existing code.

Imagine a box full of tiny polyhedral dice shaken so that they are allowed to find their most favorable state. There are no attractive forces, simply a penalty force so that particles cannot overlap. Entropy alone causes systems of hard particles to self-assemble into a variety of complex ordered phases.

### Mischkra' Opinion
Link with known materials with science formulas to create the starting database.

## 6. CUDA for Mathematics, Physics, Chemistry, Biology
### Main Idea / Dream of Glanz
From reading this:
https://developer.nvidia.com/blog/cuda-spotlight-dr-cris-cecka-on-gpu-accelerated-computational-mathematics/

CUDA is used for non-linear PDEs (partial differential equations) and real-time computing with applications in simulation and virtual surgery.
CUDA can also be used for mathematical and computational abstractions to produce efficient, library-quality scientific software. Specifically, on generalized n-body problems, including integral equation methods, particle methods, and structured dense matrices.

Plenty of algorithms exist for dense matrices, e.g. all of BLAS and LAPACK. These use values of the matrix to compute products, eigenvalues, factorizations, etc. But there are huge classes of problems where we never actually want to construct all of the elements of the matrix — generalized n-body problems — and can be accelerated either by compressing rows, columns, or blocks of the matrix or by avoiding computing elements of the matrix all-together.

Methods:
1. Summarizing basic undergraduate textbooks and knowledge that then can be used to create the library like BLAS and LAPACK for each branches of science, BLAS and LAPACK is for linear algebra, there are other Mathematics branches like Differential Equations, Probability and Statistics, Network Flows, Stochastics Process.
2. With better hardware that are being developed in the future, we can analyze through camera or our own sense that has been connected to the core intelligent of GFreya OS.

## 7. Create Swarm Robots
In this era of low consciousness ever since year 0 AD. People are still doing war because they eat too much and do not listen to Buddha, you will never die when you share your meal. In my opinion fighting over land, oil, foods are just like.. sorry to say.. well you go outside and see who do that. Plants or animals or human.. 

I saw this on Bullet, and thinking that someday swarm robots can be used to replace millions of soldiers, or just one robot. To destroy another city, nation. I might have been thinking to focus on Inventing than anything. Robots is one of my passion. Soldiers can betray you. Stalin killed his trusted general without proof that general is a spy, just use intuition. Julius Caesar was murdered. Still believe in soldiers? dogs are better and more loyal. England' soldier knew and that is why he became the first President of United States of America.. the highest of staying at old country? Military General. If I create my own nation I will be the Founding Father. That's natural.

Methods:
1. Create the source code for motion imitation, either learning from animals or human
2. Create the robot / hardware
3. Upload the code, modify and perfectioning will take place for bugs, etc.
4. We can even set target, the robot could be a drone, that could invent its own laser weapon more powerful than nuclear weapon nowaday. How? Breaking the limit of Chemistry and Physics.

### Main Idea / Dream of Glanz
1. How to create real-time human motion imitation approach to control an anthropomorphic dual arm robot or even any other robot or even imitate real-time motion of Lamborghini to Arduino RC car
2. Not only moving, but responding to output influences, feels itchy you scratch that part. Sleepy then you sleep or for other personality you try to not sleep by washing your face. Smell something that makes you allergic you will sneeze.
3. If we can imitate not only human, animals, but also plants, then the planets rotation in a solar system. then we can simulate the real world and create infinite universe that will need more than exa- or beyond that of computational power.
