# About
Glanz and Freya had created unfinished book with title of "Zerolif", it is a compilation of problems and solutions of real world problems, like when she went to Papua and had an idea to turn grasses into cellulosic biomass, creating independent energy without the need to import oil and gas from outer island.

This section is dedicated to compile the idea and use sources we get and the Science and Engineering packages that we learn till now.

One day it will be compiled and tidying up into Zerolif. 

Mischkra will help too so instead of Freya only, there will be another two names on Zerolif as authors.
