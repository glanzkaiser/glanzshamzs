# Jupyter Notebooks

Here you will find a set of notebooks.
You can embed a rendering window into your jupyter notebook via
[K3D](https://github.com/K3D-tools/K3D-jupyter),
`itkwidgets`, `ipygany`, `ipyvtk` or [panel](https://github.com/pyviz/panel)).

Moreover `K3D` allows to export an interactive
[snapshot](https://vedo.embl.es/examples/K3D_snapshot.html)
of a rendered scene.


### note that notebook support (except for `ipyvtk`) is rather limited and not all functionalities are available, in particular:

- axes are very basic
- `Text2D` is not available
- limited possibilities for scene interaction
