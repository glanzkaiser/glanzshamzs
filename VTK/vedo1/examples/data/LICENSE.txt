 Royalty Free License
 .
 This is a legally binding agreement between licensee (“you”), and
 Free3D regarding your rights to use Stock Media Products from the Site
 under this license. “You” refers to the purchasing entity, whether
 that is a natural person who must be at least 18 years of age, or a
 corporate entity. The rights granted in this agreement are granted to
 the purchasing entity, its parent company, and its majority owned
 affiliates on a “royalty free” basis, which means that after a
 Purchase, there are no future royalties or payments that are
 required. Collectively, these rights are considered “extended uses”,
 and are granted to you, subject to applicable Editorial Use
 Restrictions described below. The license granted is wholly
 transferable to other parties so long it is in force and not
 terminated, otherwise violated, or extinguished, as set forth
 herein. This agreement incorporates by reference the Terms of Use as
 well as the Site’s policies and procedures as such.
 .
 These Terms may be translated into other languages, but the governing
 language is English in the event of any contradiction in terms between
 the English and foreign translation.

 I. Introduction & Definitions
 .
 Definitions
 .
 This agreement is intended to be easy to understand, and to provide
 clarity for using Stock Media Products in the work you create
 (“Creations”). Over the years, Free3D has been asked many questions
 about how Stock Media Products may be used in Creations, and we have
 attempted to answer those questions in this agreement.
 .
 Some words in this agreement are given specific meanings. Words that
 appear initially in quotations, such as “you” and “Creations”, are
 defined in the text preceding the word. Other capitalized words are
 defined below:
 .
 * “Stock Media Product” is the collection of one or more digital
  files, packaged in the form of a product on the Site that can be
  identified by a product ID, and that is uploaded by you, or
  otherwise made available to you, for Purchase on the Site. A Stock
  Media Product may include 3D models, texture maps, motion captures,
  photographs, imagery, application and plug-in software, materials
  and shaders, shapes and vector graphics, training materials,
  building components, sound effects, stock music, and
  videos. Additionally, a Stock Media Product may include a number of
  individual files of different file formats to make it easier for
  Customers to work in a variety of software applications (such as 3ds
  Max, Maya, and Cinema 4D), and may also include other files (such as
  jpeg images used for texturing), and images or other files that are
  used for promotional purposes. For Customers and their use in
  Creations, this definition also includes derivative and intermediary
  files used for that purpose.
 * “Site” refers to the Free3D websites, API’s, software applications
  or any approved means or utility either currently in existence or in
  the future; the software and source code used by Free3D to provide
  such services; user interface layouts, designs, images, text,
  knowledge base articles, program offers; site information provided
  in reports (such as popular keyword searches); and all other
  intellectual property protected under copyright, trademark, patent,
  publicity, or any other proprietary right.
 * “Purchase” is the acquisition of a Stock Media Product by you from
  the Site under this agreement, whether as a purchase of Stock Media
  Product made available at a price of greater than $0, or a download
  of Stock Media Product made available at no charge.
 * “Free3D” includes Free3D, Inc., d/b/a the Free3D brand and all
  licensed affiliates and partners that distribute Stock Media
  Products on behalf of TurboSquid, Inc.
 * “Product Page” is the product page or interface that displays Stock
  Media Products available for Purchase on the Site.
 * “Computer Game” is a type of Creation that includes digital games,
  computer-based games, handheld electronic games, mobile games,
  online games, social games, game mods, and console-based games.
 * “Imagery” is a Creation made of any single image or sequence of
  images.
 * “Intellectual Property” means, copyright, trademark, trade secret,
  right of publicity, or any other proprietary right throughout the
  world.
 .
 To make reading this agreement easier and less repetitive, the
 following constructions are used:
 .
 “Include,” including,” and “such as” are considered to be followed
 with “but not limited to.” Examples are used in this agreement to
 illustrate, rather than limit, the scope of the terms.
 .
 “The following restrictions”, “the foregoing restrictions”, and
 “subject to the restrictions” are considered to be followed with “in
 addition to all other restrictions applicable within this agreement.”
 .
 II. License Rights
 .
 1. Ownership. Free3D does not grant title or ownership in Stock Media
    Products. All rights in Stock Media Products not expressly granted
    in this agreement are reserved by Free3D for itself and its
    licensors.
 .
 2. Rights Granted. For Stock Media Products, Free3D grants to you a
    non-exclusive, perpetual, worldwide right and license to copy,
    distribute, reproduce, adapt, publicly display, publicly perform,
    digitally perform, transmit, broadcast, telecast, advertise,
    create derivative works, and market Stock Media Products within
    Creations in the uses authorized in this agreement. You may
    request authorization for a use not covered by this agreement
    (“New Use”) by writing agent@turbosquid.com. Free3D is authorized
    to approve a New Use if Free3D finds in its sole judgment that the
    New Use is substantially similar to another established use in
    this agreement, and authorizes the New Use in writing.
 .
 3. Rights Granted When Sharing Stock Media Products. If you Purchase
    as an employee of a corporate entity,sharing Purchased Stock Media
    Products with other employees of your corporate entity is allowed.
    Examples of allowed sharing include storing files on a networked
    hard drive, and aggregating Stock Media Products for later use in
    future Creations. You are responsible for any downstream
    distribution, use, or misuse by a recipient of a shared Stock
    Media Product.In all cases, sharing Stock Media Products with
    external people or entities is only allowed in the following
    situations, and with the following restrictions:
 .
    1. In the production of a Creation owned by you, if you are
       working in collaboration with external parties, and there is a
       need to share Stock Media Products for the development and
       production of your Creation, sharing Stock Media Products with
       those external parties is allowed. Any external party that
       receives Stock Media Products may only use Stock Media Products
       on your Creations and must take reasonable care to secure and
       limit access to Stock Media Products to that purpose.
 .
    2. In the production of a Creation owned by another entity (“your
       Client”), if you are working as a contractor and need to share
       Stock Media Products with your Client, or any external parties
       working with your Client, sharing Stock Media Products is
       allowed, subject to the restriction that all parties may use
       Stock Media Products only for your Client’s particular
       Creation, and for successive versions of your Client’s
       Creation, such as sequel Computer Games or movies that utilize
       the same 3D models.  All parties must take reasonable care to
       secure and limit access to Stock Media Products to the parties
       working on your Client’s Creation. For all other use by any
       party, Stock Media Products must be Purchased again to create a
       new license agreement governing that use.
 .
 4. Editorial Use Restriction for Some Stock Media Products. The
    following restrictions apply to any Stock Media Product affixed
    with an “Editorial” notice on its Product Page. The Editorial
    notice is one way to alert you that certain subject matter
    depicted by Stock Media Products, such as a manufactured product
    under a brand name, may be protected by another party’s
    Intellectual Property rights (“Other-Party Intellectual
    Property”). Permitted use of Other-Party Intellectual Property in
    Stock Media Products is limited to news reporting in Creations of
    some cultural, editorial, journalistic, or otherwise newsworthy
    value, and includes news reporting on television and the
    internet. This restriction does not apply if you have the needed
    authorization to use the Other-Party Intellectual Property for
    your Creation, such as if you are the Intellectual Property owner
    yourself, or an Intellectual Property owner’s advertising team,
    hired party, or licensee purchasing that company’s product.
 .
 5. Other-Party Intellectual Property. Free3D does not own or license
    any Other-Party Intellectual Property. Free3D does not in any way
    make any representations or warranties about Other-Party
    Intellectual Property associated with Stock Media Products. You
    are solely responsible for determining the need for and, if
    appropriate, obtaining any needed Other-Party clearance, consent,
    or release to use any Other-Party Intellectual Property in your
    Creations.
 .
 6. *Creations of Imagery.*
 .
    *Permitted Uses of Creations of Imagery*. Subject to the following
    restrictions, you may use Creations of Imagery within news, film,
    movies, television programs, video projects, multi-media projects,
    theatrical display, software user interfaces; architectural
    renderings, Computer Games, virtual worlds, simulation and
    training environments; corporate communications, marketing
    collateral, tradeshow promotional items, booth decorations and
    presentations;
 .
    *Restrictions on Permitted Uses of Creations of Imagery.*
 .
    1. Stock Media Clearinghouse. You may NOT publish or distribute
       Creations of Imagery through another stock media clearinghouse,
       for example as part of an online marketplace for photography,
       clip art, or design templates.
 .
    2. Promotional Images. Images displayed for the promotion of Stock
       Media Products, such as preview images on the Stock Media
       Product’s Product Page (“Promotional Images”), may be used in
       Creations of Imagery, provided that the Stock Media Product
       itself has been Purchased and subject to the following
       restrictions:
 .
       1. You may NOT use a Promotional Image that has any added
          element which is not included as part of the Stock Media
          Product. An example of this type of restricted use is if the
          Stock Media Product contains a 3D model of an airplane, and
          there is a Promotional Image of that airplane rendered over
          a blue sky; however, the blue sky image is not included as
          part of the Stock Media Product. Other prohibited examples
          include use of Promotional Images from movies or
          advertisements that may have used Stock Media Product.
 .
       2. You may NOT use any Promotional Image that has a logo, mark,
          watermark, attribution, copyright or other notice
          superimposed on the image without prior approval from Free3D
          Support.
 .
    3. Business Logos. You may NOT use Imagery in any Creation that is
       a trademark, servicemark, or business logo. This restriction is
       included because the owners of these types of Creations
       typically seek exclusivity on the use of the imagery in their
       Creation, which is incompatible with the non-exclusive license
       granted to you under this agreement.
 .
 7. *Creations of Computer Games and Software.*
 .
    *Permitted Uses in Creations of Computer Games and Software.*
 .
    Subject to the following restrictions, you may include Stock Media
    Products in Creations of Computer Games, virtual worlds,
    simulation and training environments; mobile, desktop and web
    applications; and interactive electronic publications of
    literature such as e-books and electronic textbooks.
 .
    *Restrictions on Permitted Uses of Stock Media Products in
    Creations of Games and Software.*
 .
    1. Interactivity. Your inclusion of Stock Media Products within
       any such Creation is limited to uses where Stock Media Product
       is contained in an interactive experience for the user and not
       made available outside of the interactive experience. Such a
       permitted example of this use would be to include a 3D model of
       human anatomy in a medical training application, in a way that
       the 3D model or its environment may be manipulated or
       interacted with.
 .
    2. Access to Stock Media Products. You must take all reasonable and
       industry standard measures to prevent other parties from gaining
        access to Stock Media Products. Stock Media Products must be
        contained in proprietary formats so that they cannot be opened
        or imported in a publicly available software application or
        framework, or extracted without reverse engineering. You may NOT
        publish or distribute Stock Media Products in any open format,
        or format encrypted with decryptable open standards (such as
        WebGL or an encrypted compression archive).
 .
    3. Open Systems. You may NOT include Stock Media Products in
       Creations that have the general functionality for importing
       and/or exporting Stock Media Products. An example of such a
       prohibited use is to include Stock Media Products as a starter
       library within a Creation that allows users to generally work
       with 3D models, even if the Stock Media Product itself is
       somehow protected and is not capable of being
       exported. Instead, the users of such a software application may
       Purchase Stock Media Products directly from the Site.
 .
    4. Virtual Good Sales. You may NOT import, upload, reproduce, make
       available, publish, transmit, distribute, or sublicense Stock
       Media Products in Creations of virtual goods or worlds for any
       3D community (“Virtual World”), unless you or your Client owns
       the Virtual World platform and it complies with the foregoing
       restrictions.
 .
 8. *Creations of Physical Form.*
 .
    *Permitted Uses in Creations of Physical Form.*
 .
     Subject to the following restrictions, you may use Stock Media
     Products to make physical Creations such as 3D printed works,
     articles of manufacture, custom vehicles, furniture, jewelry,
     sculptural artwork, toys, and physical entertainment goods
     (“Creations of Physical Form”).
 .
    *Restrictions on Permitted Uses in Creations of Physical Form.*
 .
    1. Substantially Similar Creations. Permitted use of any Creation
       of Physical Form in which a Stock Media Product is
       untransformed or substantially similar to the Stock Media
       Product, is limited to personal use, gifts, or charitable
       donations, with a maximum of 5 instances of such Creation per
       Purchase; unless the Stock Media Product is a small part of a
       much larger array of other physical objects in the
       Creation. For example, if you are creating a real-world,
       physical human skeleton for manufacture for sale, it is
       permitted to add a 3D printed human head that exactly resembles
       the Purchased Stock Media Product, but it is not permitted to
       sell the 3D printed head by itself. Another permitted example
       of a Stock Media Product being a small part of a larger array
       is using a 3D model that ends up within an automobile as a part
       of the automobile.
 .
    2. No Other-Party Intellectual Property. You may NOT reproduce
       Other-Party Intellectual Property in any Creation of Physical
       Form for any purpose.
 .
 9. 3D Industry Promotional Use. If Free3D has granted you, as a
    hardware or software partner, access to priced Stock Media
    Products on a free-of-charge basis, your use of Stock Media
    Products is restricted to internal testing for your 3D software or
    hardware products, and to the promotion of your software or
    hardware products with Creations of Imagery provided that an
    attribution of the artist’s name and the Site are included. You
    agree that should any Stock Media Products be used outside of
    these purposes in ways that are normally allowed after a Purchase,
    that you will promptly Purchase the Stock Media Products and
    otherwise comply with the terms herein.
 .
 10. Unauthorized Use. If you use Stock Media Products in an
     unauthorized way, Free3D may terminate your account and pursue
     other penalties, damages, losses, and profits Free3D is entitled
     to under this agreement or at law or equity. The following are
     unauthorized uses that are explicitly prohibited:
 .
     1. Competition. You may NOT use Stock Media Products in a way
        that competes with the Site or the Stock Media Products
        themselves.
 .
     2. Re-Distribution. You may NOT re-distribute, publish, or make
        Stock Media Products available to any third party except in
        the form of a permitted Creation, or shared as authorized in
        this agreement.
 .
     3. Group Buying. You may NOT aggregate funds to Purchase Stock
        Media Products with one or more other parties. An example of
        this prohibited use is a website membership where members pool
        their money to make a single Purchase that is shared by the
        members of the group. Each such member must Purchase
        individually.
 .
     4. Stock Media Product Clearinghouses. You may NOT publish,
        distribute, or make Stock Media Products available through any
        online clearinghouse infrastructure.
 .
     5. No Obscene or Unlawful Use. You may NOT use Stock Media
        Products for any defamatory, harassing, pornographic, obscene,
        or racist purpose, or to infringe any party’s Intellectual
        Property rights.
 .
     6. False Attribution. You may NOT misrepresent yourself as the
        creator of Stock Media Products.
 .
 III. License Term & Termination
 .
 1. Term. Your right and license to Stock Media Products is perpetual,
    unless terminated as described herein.
 .
 2. Termination. Your license grant is terminated immediately and
    without notice in the cases below. In such termination, you and
    any recipients of Stock Media Products must cease use,
    distribution, and destroy all copies of Stock Media Products.
 .
    1. Reversal of Purchase. Your right and license to Stock Media
       Products are contingent on your Purchase of Stock Media
       Products. Any payment reversal of a Purchase for any reason
       immediately terminates all rights granted under this agreement.
       Potential Reasons for a payment reversal include:
 .
       1. Free3D reverses your Purchase at your request.
       2. Free3D receives a charge back notice from your bank or
          credit card cancelling your Purchase and withdrawing the
          funds used for your Purchase.
       3. Free3D determines in its sole discretion that your Purchase
          was fraudulent.
       4. Your purchase was made with a dishonored check.
       5. Your purchase was made and there is a bank transfer failure.
       6. When you are granted delayed payment terms, and fail to make
          payments such that Free3D sends you notice and terminates
          your account.
 .
     2. Failure to Abide by the License Grant. Material failure to
        abide by the terms of this agreement immediately terminates
        your right and license to Stock Media Products. If you detect
        a violation of the license grant by you or any recipient of
        shared Stock Media Products, and promptly report the violation
        to agent@turbosquid.com, Free3D will make a good faith effort
        to find an appropriate remedy to preserve your license grant.

 You covenant, represent, and warrant to Free3D that:
 .
 1. You have full right, power, legal capacity, and authority to enter
    into and perform this agreement, have obtained any third-party
    consent needed to do so, and, prior to any Purchase, had an
    opportunity to seek independent legal counsel.

    exercised by Free3D under this agreement or applicable law.

    appropriate, obtain any needed third-party clearance, consent, or
    release to use Other-Party Intellectual Property shown in the
    digital rendering of Stock Media Products, and shall not use Stock
    Media Products to infringe any party’s Intellectual Property
    rights.
 .
 4. You will immediately notify Free3D of any Intellectual Property
    claim against your use of Stock Media Products or any other rights
    issue, before disclosing such issue to any third-party.
 .
 V. Limitation of Liability
 .
 1. Stock Media Products are provided on an “as is”, “as available”,
    and “with all faults” basis. Free3D makes no representations,
    warranties, conditions, or guarantees as to the usefulness,
    quality, suitability, truth, fitness for a particular purpose,
    non-infringement, merchantability, or cosmetic attributes of Stock
    Media Products, and does not guarantee the accuracy or
    completeness of specifications associated with Stock Media
    Products, including measurements, weight, durability, strength,
    materials, general physical properties, regulatory compliance,
    other engineering or construction attributes.
 .
 2. Free3D disclaims all express or implied conditions,
    representations, and warranties of any kind regarding Stock Media
    Products, including any implied warranty or condition of
    merchantability. Free3D allows your Purchase to be refunded under
    certain reasonable time frames and conditions, subject to the
    Site’s policies.
 .
 3. You assume all risk for any damage to your computer systems and
    network for any damage to your computer system by obtaining Stock

    viruses.
 .
 4. To the fullest extent permitted by law, Free3D shall not be liable
    for any direct, indirect, punitive, special, incidental,
    consequential, or exemplary damages (including loss of business,
    revenue, profits, goodwill, use, data, electronically transmitted
    orders, or other economic advantage) arising out of or in
    connection with Stock Media Products, even if Free3D has
    previously been advised of, or reasonably could have foreseen, the
    possibility of such damages, however they arise, whether in breach
    of contract or in tort (including negligence). To the extent that
    any jurisdiction does not allow the exclusion or limitation of
    direct, incidental, or consequential damages, portions of the
    preceding limitation or exclusion may not apply, but should be
    construed to the greatest extent applicable in such jurisdictions.
 .
 5. You agree to indemnify and hold Free3D and its subsidiaries,
    affiliates, shareholders, officers, directors, agents, licensors,
    licensee, suppliers, alliance members, other partners, employees
    and representatives (“Free3D Parties”) harmless from any claim or
    demand, including reasonable attorneys’ fees, made by any third
    party due to, or arising out of your use of the Source Material or
    Creations.
 .
 VI. Other Terms
 .
 1. Entire Agreement. This agreement constitutes the entire agreement
    between you and Free3D relating to your Purchase, unless you have
    a corporate license agreement with Free3D. Corporate licenses are
    available with additional protections for additional fees. Please
    contact agent@turbosquid.com if your organization requires a
    corporate license. Free3D does not otherwise offer any other
    changes, additions, variations, or additional signed forms related
    to this agreement. No modification to this agreement will be
    binding, unless in writing and signed by an authorized Free3D
    representative.
 .
 2. Material Breach. You agree that any material breach of these Terms
    will result in irreparable harm to Free3D for which damages would
    be an inadequate remedy and, therefore, in addition to its rights
    and remedies otherwise available at law, Free3D will be entitled
    to equitable relief, including both a preliminary and permanent
    injunction, if such a breach occurs. You waive any requirement for
    the posting of a bond or other security if Free3D seeks such an
    injunction.
 .
 3. Import/Export Regulations. Stock Media Products may be subject to
    the U.S. export laws and the export or import laws of other
    countries. You agree to comply strictly with all such laws and, in
    particular, shall with Stock Media Products: (a) obtain any
    export, re-export, or import authorizations required by U.S. or
    Your local laws; (b) not design, develop or produce missile,
    chemical/biological, or nuclear weaponry; and (c) not provide
    Stock Media Products to prohibited countries and entities
    identified in the U.S. export regulations.
 .
 4. Governing Law. This agreement is governed by New York law,
    excluding conflict of law principles. Any action or proceeding
    arising out of or related to this agreement must be brought in a
    state or federal court located in New York, New York, and both
    parties irrevocably submit to the exclusive jurisdiction of such
    courts. All notices, requests and other communications under this
    agreement must be in writing (e-mail messages shall be deemed
    writings).
 .
 5. LIMITED INTERNAL USER ARBITRATION. You acknowledge and agree that
    Free3D may, in its sole discretion, arbitrate disputes between
    Free3D users involving Stock Media Products (including any
    purchaser or supplier of Stock Media Products), and such findings
    shall be final and non-appealable. Either party may request that
    Free3D arbitrate the dispute, or Free3D may elect, at its option,
    to arbitrate the dispute. After Free3D elects to arbitrate any
    dispute hereunder, Free3D will waive any rights to a commission
    from both the Purchase and arbitration, and the parties must keep
    the results and process confidential and may not disclose anything
    related to the dispute to any other party (whether by oral,
    written, or other type of disclosure). To resolve disputes, Free3D
    may decide to terminate or suspend users, revoke the license,
    offer replacement Stock Media Products, reestablish the licensee,
    or surrender or reallocate fees (whether by refund, charitable
    donation, or otherwise). Free3D may award up to 3X the Purchase
    price to either party depending on the circumstances. YOU
    UNDERSTAND, ACKNOWLEDGE, AND AGREE THAT ACCEPTING THIS ARBITRATION
    PROVISION WAIVES RIGHTS TO JUDICIAL RESOLUTION, TRIAL BY JURY AND
    RIGHTS YOU WOULD OTHERWISE HAVE IF YOU HAD NOT AGREED TO THIS
    ARBITRATION PROVISION.
 .
 6. Notice. Any notice under this agreement shall be via email to
    agent@turbosquid.com, provided that you receive an acknowledgement
    email from a Free3D representative within 5 business days. If no
    such acknowledgement email is received, notice must be in writing
    and delivered by mail to the following address.

    without providing you notice, except in the case of a bankruptcy,
    merger, acquisition, sale of all or substantially all of Free3D’s
    assets to a subsequent owner or operator, or similar event. You
    may not assign your rights under this agreement without the prior
    written consent of Free3D, which will not be unreasonably
    withheld.
 .
 8. English. This agreement may be translated into other languages,
    but English is the official language of this agreement and in any
    conflict between the English language version and any other
    version, the English language version shall control.

Licence: LGPL-3
                   GNU LESSER GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE
                       Version 3, 29 June 2007
 .
 Copyright (C) 2007 Free Software Foundation, Inc. <http://fsf.org/>
 Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies
 of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.
 .
  This version of the GNU Lesser General Public License incorporates
 the terms and conditions of version 3 of the GNU General Public
 License, supplemented by the additional permissions listed below.
 .
  0. Additional Definitions.
 .
  As used herein, "this License" refers to version 3 of the GNU Lesser
 General Public License, and the "GNU GPL" refers to version 3 of the GNU
 General Public License.
 .
  "The Library" refers to a covered work governed by this License,
 other than an Application or a Combined Work as defined below.
 .
  An "Application" is any work that makes use of an interface provided
 by the Library, but which is not otherwise based on the Library.
 Defining a subclass of a class defined by the Library is deemed a mode
 of using an interface provided by the Library.
 .
  A "Combined Work" is a work produced by combining or linking an
 Application with the Library.  The particular version of the Library
 with which the Combined Work was made is also called the "Linked
 Version".
 .
  The "Minimal Corresponding Source" for a Combined Work means the
 Corresponding Source for the Combined Work, excluding any source code
 for portions of the Combined Work that, considered in isolation, are
 based on the Application, and not on the Linked Version.
 .
  The "Corresponding Application Code" for a Combined Work means the
 object code and/or source code for the Application, including any data
 and utility programs needed for reproducing the Combined Work from the
 Application, but excluding the System Libraries of the Combined Work.
 .
  1. Exception to Section 3 of the GNU GPL.
 .
  You may convey a covered work under sections 3 and 4 of this License
 without being bound by section 3 of the GNU GPL.
 .
  2. Conveying Modified Versions.
 .
  If you modify a copy of the Library, and, in your modifications, a
 facility refers to a function or data to be supplied by an Application
 that uses the facility (other than as an argument passed when the
 facility is invoked), then you may convey a copy of the modified
 version:
 .
   a) under this License, provided that you make a good faith effort to
   ensure that, in the event an Application does not supply the
   function or data, the facility still operates, and performs
   whatever part of its purpose remains meaningful, or
 .
   b) under the GNU GPL, with none of the additional permissions of
   this License applicable to that copy.
 .
  3. Object Code Incorporating Material from Library Header Files.
 .
  The object code form of an Application may incorporate material from
 a header file that is part of the Library.  You may convey such object
 code under terms of your choice, provided that, if the incorporated
 material is not limited to numerical parameters, data structure
 layouts and accessors, or small macros, inline functions and templates
 (ten or fewer lines in length), you do both of the following:
 .
   a) Give prominent notice with each copy of the object code that the
   Library is used in it and that the Library and its use are
   covered by this License.
 .
   b) Accompany the object code with a copy of the GNU GPL and this license
   document.
 .
  4. Combined Works.
 .
  You may convey a Combined Work under terms of your choice that,
 taken together, effectively do not restrict modification of the
 portions of the Library contained in the Combined Work and reverse
 engineering for debugging such modifications, if you also do each of
 the following:
 .
   a) Give prominent notice with each copy of the Combined Work that
   the Library is used in it and that the Library and its use are
   covered by this License.
 .
   b) Accompany the Combined Work with a copy of the GNU GPL and this license
   document.
 .
   c) For a Combined Work that displays copyright notices during
   execution, include the copyright notice for the Library among
   these notices, as well as a reference directing the user to the
   copies of the GNU GPL and this license document.
 .
   d) Do one of the following:
 .
       0) Convey the Minimal Corresponding Source under the terms of this
       License, and the Corresponding Application Code in a form
       suitable for, and under terms that permit, the user to
       recombine or relink the Application with a modified version of
       the Linked Version to produce a modified Combined Work, in the
       manner specified by section 6 of the GNU GPL for conveying
       Corresponding Source.
 .
       1) Use a suitable shared library mechanism for linking with the
       Library.  A suitable mechanism is one that (a) uses at run time
       a copy of the Library already present on the user's computer
       system, and (b) will operate properly with a modified version
       of the Library that is interface-compatible with the Linked
       Version.
 .
   e) Provide Installation Information, but only if you would otherwise
   be required to provide such information under section 6 of the
   GNU GPL, and only to the extent that such information is
   necessary to install and execute a modified version of the
   Combined Work produced by recombining or relinking the
   Application with a modified version of the Linked Version. (If
   you use option 4d0, the Installation Information must accompany
   the Minimal Corresponding Source and Corresponding Application
   Code. If you use option 4d1, you must provide the Installation
   Information in the manner specified by section 6 of the GNU GPL
   for conveying Corresponding Source.)
 .
  5. Combined Libraries.
 .
  You may place library facilities that are a work based on the
 Library side by side in a single library together with other library
 facilities that are not Applications and are not covered by this
 License, and convey such a combined library under terms of your
 choice, if you do both of the following:
 .
   a) Accompany the combined library with a copy of the same work based
   on the Library, uncombined with any other library facilities,
   conveyed under the terms of this License.
 .
   b) Give prominent notice with the combined library that part of it
   is a work based on the Library, and explaining where to find the
   accompanying uncombined form of the same work.
 .
  6. Revised Versions of the GNU Lesser General Public License.
 .
 The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new versions
 of the GNU Lesser General Public License from time to time. Such new
 versions will be similar in spirit to the present version, but may
 differ in detail to address new problems or concerns.
 .
  Each version is given a distinguishing version number. If the
 Library as you received it specifies that a certain numbered version
 of the GNU Lesser General Public License "or any later version"
 applies to it, you have the option of following the terms and
 conditions either of that published version or of any later version
 published by the Free Software Foundation. If the Library as you
 received it does not specify a version number of the GNU Lesser
 General Public License, you may choose any version of the GNU Lesser
 General Public License ever published by the Free Software Foundation.
 .
  If the Library as you received it specifies that a proxy can decide
 whether future versions of the GNU Lesser General Public License shall
 apply, that proxy's public statement of acceptance of any version is
 permanent authorization for you to choose that version for the
 Library.
