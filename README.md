# Why We Create this repository?
When we created GFreya OS, we have a plan on our mind to create a software like MATLAB but for different branch of science and engineering. Let me introduce those:
1. Hamzstlab -> for Physics
2. Mischkra -> for Biology
3. Nagiconomy -> for Economy
4. Freyalab -> for Electrical Engineering
5. Franziskleus -> for Chemistry
6. Lasthrim Projection -> for Mathematics
7. Lucriflaw -> for Laws
8. MechanicZals -> for Mechanical Engineering
9. GlanzDog -> for understanding dog / man's best friend more and how to handle difficulty like when they get Parvo or Poisoned
10. Caldraz n Tetsugaku -> for Philosophy

We think to create a software like MATLAB will takes time and needs foundation. That is why we will create the books then the software just like how VTK was made, one by one. Books last forever. Knowledge never dies. 

Starting with Hamzstlab and Lasthrim Projection, then move on to other till they all will be finished one day.

We will take the base knowledge level from undergraduate level till PhD if possible. 

# Background Story
Glanz has new hobby since she first came to Papua she learned that cutting grasses is fun, thus she keeps doing it everyday till now (May 1st 2022),
Then she thought "hey, this grasses piling up, someone will be questioning and I have to be responsible, I will turn this pile into energy one day, how?"
She asked nature, trees and all universe to guide her. Well, that is why she has to learn all the branches of science then engineering, because the solution to human problems, needs a feasible solution, that can be used at your local place, in order to create the solution one must have the basic knowledge, if we are given a talent, will we let it be? bury it? or multiply it till become hundreds times to infinity? Your life, your time, your choice.

Another problem is burning trashes, unhealthy for human, but they do not know (especially in poor countries) how to treat trashes correctly.

A lot of problems around, and we want to solve them, but we need to learn together, to give a feasible, affordable, and efficient solution, if it is working at your place does not mean it will works in another place, say Milan.

Congratulation for your Master degree Glanz, hopefully it will brings more knowledge and ideas for us the 8 Queens.

| Name | Details |
| -------------     | ------------- | 
| GSL               | Create examples and simulate
| oneTBB            | Create examples and simulate
| ODE               | Will check and simulate
| Kratos            | Rebuild to add all applications, simulate and see the different between Chrono
| Project Chrono    | Compile successful till 100% but Demo of CityBus can't work
| PyBullet          | Will check and simulate
| Tokamak           | Can't be installed with premake -> Learn to create demo with the headers (.h) and OpenGL
| Trilinos          | Built successful, without MPI and OpenMP, able to compile and run a single Anasazi example
