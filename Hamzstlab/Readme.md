Learning Physics will rule the world said my mentor once -Glanz
```
  Even if most of you will laugh, my mentor is an invisible force, unseen by eyes, untouched by tangible senses, Albert Silverberg from Suikoden III, thanks for everything. Better be honest than lie. Most gamers will love this part.
 
 That was in Junior High School, around 2004 or 2005 when I was poor, i just learn so I can focus my mind on something better than playing around.
 I was lucky to born poor, like George Soros said "If you were born poor it is not your fault."
 
 Andrew Carnegie was poor. Forever 21 founders are poor, immigrants who have nothing but bravery and intention to be successful. 
 
 Then internet coming in, the founder is a Physics student from Oxford, working at CERN. The money makers are the derivatives startups that will busts in certain patterns and time.
 The top knowledge still rule. CERN is great, I wish to have better innovation than Large Hadron Collider in this incarnation.
 
This Hamzstlab will be filled with simulation or dynamics of Physics by using computers, from Physics undergraduate book, and if we are finished we will move on to the next level.

Till AliceGard will be created one day.

But then, Lasthrim still have fun sitting on her throne, since Mathematics is the integral of Physics. Maybe humans on earth only bounded with Physics. When we have highest consciousness able to comprehend the highest power / Goddesses / Divine Power. We will understand more beyond what can be seen.

So in the end, Joker is right to burn the money? Since he still be happy and alive after burning the money.

#### P.S. Joker is Hamzst' favorite Guardian Force.
