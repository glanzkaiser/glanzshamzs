# Economic Problems
We are going to summarize economic problems and find the solution to eliminate poverty and inequality, with the tools of science, engineering, technology and other fields.

## 1. United Kingdom
1. UK has the highest inﬂation in the G7
2. Britain is stuck in a 15 year low productivity rut. 
3. ts current account deﬁcit has ballooned, sterling has tumbled and debt interest costs are rising. 

## 2. United States
1. 

## 3. Worldwide
1. During the ﬁrst two years of the pandemic more than 80% of schooldays in Latin America and South Asia were disrupted by closures of some sort. Even today schools in some countries, such as the Philippines, remain shut to most pupils. The harm that school closures have done to children has vastly outweighed any beneﬁts they may have had for public health.  If children cannot read and understand a simple story, they will struggle to earn a good living. Nearly every problem that confronts humanity can be alleviated by good schooling. Better educated people are more likely to devise a cleaner energy source, a cure for malaria or a smarter town plan. Workers who can read and manipulate numbers are more productive. Bookish populations will ﬁnd it easier to adapt to climate change. They will also have fewer babies, and educate them better. If the damage the pandemic has done to education is not reversed, all these goals will be harder to reach.
