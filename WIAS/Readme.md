# About
The Weierstrass Institute conducts project oriented research in applied mathematics with the aim of solving complex problems in technology, science and the economy. The institute deals with the whole scientific solution process, starting with mathematical modeling, followed by the theoretical analysis of models, and ending with the numerical simulation of the solution. In this context, the WIAS maintains long term, wide-ranging contacts with those who apply mathematics in industry and other areas of research and for whom it is a reliable partner.

The institute's core strengths are applied analysis and stochastics, developing and implementing numerical algorithms, and producing scientific software, as well as the consistent mathematical modeling of scientific and technological phenomena, and suitably combining all these strengths. Due to this wide range of strengths, WIAS is able to work on complex problems over long periods of time and through different phases, as well as tackle new problems and deliver fast solutions.

Application areas are oriented towards social requirements like the utilization of energy, development of medicine, research on material characteristics, or the quality analysis of technological innovations, which are reflected through our main areas of application: 
1. Conversion, Storage and Distribution of Energy
2. Flow and Transport 
3. Materials Modeling
4. Nano- and Optoelectronics
5. Optimization and Control in Technology and Economy
6. Quantitative Biomedicine

It is becoming more and more important to extract structure from very large disordered data sets or to give reliable statements about a process, even when the input data is subject to uncertainty. To solve these kinds of problems, WIAS combines methods from statistics, partial (stochastic) differential equations and numerics.

# Research
The Weierstrass Institute dedicates itself to fundamental mathematical research in analysis, stochastics and numerical methods, as well as the development of algorithms and scientific software, and the software's long-term maintenance. During the problem-solving process, mathematical models of physical and technological systems are designed that properly capture observed phenomena, thereby providing access to highly developed mathematical analysis. At WIAS the phases of the solving process are repeated and coordinated until an optimal solution is found.
