# Cases
## 1. United States

### 1. Roe vs Wade (2022)
Roe v. Wade, 410 U.S. 113 (1973),was a landmark decision of the U.S. Supreme Court in which the Court ruled that the Constitution of the United States conferred the right to choose to have an abortion. The decision struck down many federal and state abortion laws, and fueled an ongoing abortion debate in the United States about whether, or to what extent, abortion should be legal, who should decide the legality of abortion, and what the role of moral and religious views in the political sphere should be. The decision also shaped debate concerning which methods the Supreme Court should use in constitutional adjudication. 

The case was brought by Norma McCorvey—known by the legal pseudonym "Jane Roe"—who in 1969 became pregnant with her third child. McCorvey wanted an abortion, but she lived in Texas where abortion was illegal, except when necessary to save the mother's life. Her attorneys, Sarah Weddington and Linda Coffee, filed a lawsuit on her behalf in U.S. federal court against her local district attorney, Henry Wade, alleging that Texas's abortion laws were unconstitutional. A special three-judge court of the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of Texas heard the case and ruled in her favor. The parties appealed this ruling to the Supreme Court. 

In 2022, certain states if woman gets abortion she is breaking the law, even if her pregnancy is the result of a rape. Is it fair? Think if it is happening to you.

Today's condition: federal laws do not reﬂect what Americans actually want.

#### Glanz' Thoughts
I read a book in a local library at the Jesuit place in Waghete. The book' tittle is forgotten by me, but there is a words saying from local Papuans
```
male and female have to be separated from child
```
Forget about family, if you read Economist thoroughly, in Brazil a girl is pregnant because her uncle raped her for years. Where are the parents? They are to blame first since they brought the child in to the world without give her equal start. Let's examine successful Brazilian, Alessandra Ambrosio, Izabel Goulart, Gisele Bundchen(half German), what if they were that little girl? If she is protected and given a good law that could makes her as successful as those supermodels. Why the President can still drink wine peacefully now? Remember if she becomes successful she will become an asset to your country, create a lot of great chain of effects and opening new labor opprtunity. Rape and Molestation give trauma no matter how long. Nadya Murad' book will never be realized if the law only applied at one country or only a law but never truly live within.

You are what you eat. You eat bad, what goes out will be? bad menure, smells bad. If one does not love another, then do not force them or rape or molest them. They want to be with the one they truly love not based on force (except role playing).

If this is not going to be internationally applied. Brutally disciplined all those thinking they are above the other. Otherwise. Let's examine with new technology, rapists all around the world. Let's humiliate you..

Youtube will be banckrupt..

Next social(scratch it) media -> real life no lies.. I want to see how JD' CEO raped a girl, can he even makes her orgasm? or give her full sensation? how is his genital? You will be a laughing stock.. that is for example.. You want that? It will happens with or without me.. 
Be grateful, you have a beautiful wife, rich or poor you are still the same. Do not trust by words, proof it first. Everyone can say "Love" and "I will die for you.." Truth? With technology we can see who is the real deal. Law and technology enhance each other.

Trust me.. Lucrif is the other co-author. I am not the only vessel. 

A spin-off or suggestion a bit wild from me: If no abortion then bring the rapist and brutally torture him till death and the one torture that person will get USD 100,000. Fair enough? Want a crazy world, it will happens if you always bring inequality especially to female. They are smarter, more independent, smarter, and will wipe out any that bother them.
```
"Si tu es le fils de Dieu et descends de la croix" 
```

but he never descends from the cross thus have hundreds of millions praying under His name till now. The one said that never even mentioned who.. Need proof? Will your name be on history on the galaxy stone tablet? or our name? which side will you choose? use your third eye. What can be seen can be gone.
